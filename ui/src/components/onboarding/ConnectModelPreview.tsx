/**
 * A prototype of the connect step, from the PCLP-Onboarding file (nodes
 * 2941:8291 and 2933:4592).
 *
 * A mock, not the shipped step. The wizard's real step 4 probes the environment
 * before hiring and gates the key on the source; none of that is wired up here.
 * What is here is the part the design is actually asking a question about — how
 * the row of sources reads as you point at it, pick one, and flip the whole row
 * between subscription and API credentials — so it can be judged before any of
 * that machinery is moved.
 *
 * It lives in `components/` rather than beside a story because two surfaces
 * render it: the Storybook stories, and the standalone
 * `connect-model-preview.html` entry that gets deployed for review. A copy in
 * each would have drifted the moment one was tweaked.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches a backend, and it needs none of the app's providers —
 * every piece it composes is presentational.
 */

/**
 * The sources the prototype offers, matching the shipped step's own list.
 *
 * Written out rather than read from the display registry: this file renders in
 * Storybook and in a standalone `connect-model-preview.html` entry with no app
 * providers around it. `getAdapterDisplay` would work — it is a static table —
 * but pulling one adapter's entry out of it here would couple a design
 * prototype to the app's adapter registry to draw three boxes, and the next
 * adapter would mean editing a module this file deliberately does not reach for.
 *
 * The convention is a manual one: keep this equal to the adapters
 * `adapter-display-registry.ts` marks `recommended`, because the shipped step's
 * row is built from exactly that filter and a source here that is not
 * `recommended` is a tile the wizard could never render.
 *
 * Only one half of that is enforced. `adapter-display-registry.test.ts` pins the
 * registry's set exactly, so a fourth `recommended` adapter fails there — but
 * this list is not read by it, so a tile added here alone fails nothing. A
 * prototype that drew a tile the product had withdrawn is the failure this note
 * is here to prevent, and it is caught by reading both, not by a test.
